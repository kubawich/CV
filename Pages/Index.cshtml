		<h2>The beginning</h2>
		<h5 class="story">
			&nbsp;&emsp;&ensp;My coding adventure has started with day of my 10th birthday when I got my first private laptop. I've started reading
			about windows shell batch scripts, I've red tons of docs, tutorials and posts about basic scripting concepts, and starting with
			simple calculators and notepads, I finished batch's chapter with several really complex chat bots. In general I wrote over 50 batch scripts in 2 years.
			Unfortunately I tried to find my old youtube chanel where I was posting my coding progress but it was deleted.
		</h5>
		<br />
		<h2>Huge fail</h2>
		<h5 class="story">
			&nbsp;&emsp;&ensp;I wanted to start sth serious, like generating .exe files, manipulate deeper system's functions, create GUI etc.
			Internet told me that C++ will be great as first coding language for young beginner(sic!) Why not, I thought. I've downloaded
			my first serious IDE code::blocks and compiler, opened Polsih cpp course and started writing. I knew basic concepts from batch
			such as loops, variables and streams but there it was 100x easier. I didn't want to write simple calculatros because i had lot
			of them written in batch, so started reading about games development, sfml, opengl and shaders. As 15 years old boy, I couldn't
			even understand percent of these concepts so I started loosing my willing to code, and started doing stuff in Blender3D, and was getting
			back maybe once per 3 months to wirte simple tool like BMI calculator, just to not forget everything and it was some kind of crossword substitute for me
		</h5>
		<h2>Serious bussiness</h2>
		<h5 class="story">
			&nbsp;&emsp;&ensp;October, first year of high school, friend of mine convinced me to go to Warsaw's university free .NET bootcamp called `Junior .NET`.
			Took my ubuntu laptop, installed mono runtime and I was shocked  about C#, how great and easy it was! First lesson wasn't more than introduction to Console.Write(),
			but I was so impressed that after this first lesson I came back to my old passion and started writing tons of small programs as I would be back to my Windows batch times.
			Ofc. after a bit of time I wanted to make sth bigger, better, more pretty and more sophisticated, so I started reading about WinForms, and after week I wrote <a href="https://github.com/kubawich/Name-Generator">this</a>
			I spent so much time on forums looking for simpliest waysto solve problems. I've learnt lot of stuff during this project like WinForms, Git, Generics and Arrays, and optimization.
			Now when I see this code I laugh out of solutions I wrote to achieve this. But on another bootcamp meeting on University I wrote <a href="https://github.com/kubawich/RayMarching">this</a>.
			It was my implementation of Ray Marching algorithm I learnt when I was studying graphics concepts for Blender, it is much better than prevoius one, it has abstractions, objects and WinDraw.
			During next months I wrote several applications which You can check on <a href="https://github.com/kubawich?tab=repositories">my GitHub.</a>
			After several months, I got back to game development of which I was thinking since I started coding. Because of C# I took Unity, It was easy to start, so my first project was android jumping game,
			I finished it in 4 months, and it turned out that it's not that easy as I expected, I had hundreds lines of spaghetti and unefficient code, but it  was working so I decided to put it in Amazon store,
			You can find it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N31JLIJ">here!</a> After creating several other mobile games(which You can still find on <a href="https://github.com/kubawich?tab=repositories">my GitHub</a>)
			I decided to make sth bigger, and 3D, so I decided to write modular sandbox which you can easily turn into real game later. I was working on it for 6 months, and sometimes i was recording videos from proggress
			for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ojD7gMlvd54-YGf2fR3Ag?view_as=subscriber">my YouTube chanel.</a> After i started feeling routine in that long development I decided to try sth new, and I picked ASP.NET core and Razor.
			On first I wrote web crawler wchich I used to download huge amount of images in short time, to have material to work with. I set up my crawler for night, and at the morning I had prepared database of 10000 images. That was enough to experiment.
			I had no previous knowledge of ASP.NET nor a Razor nor web development stack so I just learnt everything during development, and that's how in 1.5 month I wrote my latest project <a href="http://nsfwpics.pw">NSFWpics</a>.
			During it's development i learnt most in my career, like: server optimization, web api, distributed servers(main, and cdn), ASP.NET razor, MySQL, JS, RWD, Git and BASH scripts, kestrel proxying, advertisement, speed and size optimization, SEO, size reduction
			HTTP requests, REST, and i guess mostly debuging =D
